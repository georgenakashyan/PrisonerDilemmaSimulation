# Prisoner's Dilemma Network Simulation

A comprehensive Python simulation of the Prisoner's Dilemma game on various network topologies using evolutionary game theory principles. This project implements agent-based modeling to study cooperation and defection dynamics in social networks.

## üéØ Overview

This simulation explores how cooperation emerges and evolves in populations connected through different network structures. Players make strategic decisions (cooperate or defect) based on their neighbors' actions and payoffs, following evolutionary game theory principles with Fermi updating rules.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **`main.py`** - Interactive CLI interface for simulation configuration
- **`evolutionary_game_theory.py`** - Core simulation engine implementing game mechanics
- **`time_series_plots.py`** - Time series visualization and analysis
- **`density_plots.py`** - Cooperation density heat map generation
- **`degree_dist.py`** - Network degree distribution analysis

### Network Types Supported

1. **Watts-Strogatz (ws)** - Small-world networks with configurable clustering
2. **Facebook (fb)** - Real social network from Facebook combined dataset
3. **Big Facebook (bfb)** - Extended Facebook network dataset
4. **GitHub (gh)** - Developer collaboration network from GitHub
5. **2D Grid (2d)** - Regular lattice topology

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install networkx numpy matplotlib moviepy
```

### Required Data Files

- `facebook_combined.txt.gz` - Facebook social network
- `BFacebook.csv` - Extended Facebook dataset  
- `musae_git_edges.csv` - GitHub collaboration network

### Running a Simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure:
1. Network type (ws/fb/bfb/gh/2d)
2. Network parameters (nodes, edges for synthetic networks)
3. Game parameters (games, turns, initial cooperators)
4. Strategy updating mechanism
5. Payoff matrix selection

## üé≤ Game Mechanics

### Prisoner's Dilemma Payoff Matrix

Players receive payoffs based on mutual interactions:
- **Mutual Cooperation (CC)**: Both benefit
- **Mutual Defection (DD)**: No benefit  
- **Exploitation (CD/DC)**: Defector benefits, cooperator pays cost

Example payoff matrices:
- **Watts-Strogatz**: `[[1.5, -0.3], [1.8, 0]]`
- **Facebook**: `[[14.5, -0.5], [15, 0]]`
- **GitHub**: `[[2.7, -0.3], [3, 0]]`

### Strategy Updating Rules

**Strategy 1: Payoff-Based (Fermi Rule)**
```python
P(i‚Üíj) = 1 / (1 + e^(-Œ≤(w_j - w_i)))
```
- `Œ≤`: Selection intensity (0-1)
- `w_i, w_j`: Payoffs of players i and j

**Strategy 2: Popularity-Based**
- Players adopt strategies from most connected successful neighbors
- `Œ≤ = degree(j) / (total_nodes - 1)`
